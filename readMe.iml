This is the first program written while praticing course
selection on LinkedIn.  This program is designed to inform
programmers of signed and unsigned values.


Currency Practice.
Doing math operations using int, double, float, and long
data types can be tricky.  You might find yourself rounding
up or down in order to achieve your desired output.  The
BigDecimalRunner class converts a number into a string object
and then converts it into a BigDecimal object in order to use
the math functions within that class.  Added a gitignore
file to play with it.

Managing character values as primitives.
CharArrayRunner practices creating objects from strings and
arrays.

StringPrinter
The string printer is a hackerrank problem for a programmer.
The code that is within the program here is functional,
however, on hackerrank it is not favored.  On Hackerrank, it
teaches the student that sometimes the line needs to be cleared
in order for a method like nextLine() can be used appropriately.
