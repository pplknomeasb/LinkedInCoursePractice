This is the first program written while praticing course
selection on LinkedIn.  This program is designed to inform
programmers of signed and unsigned values.


Currency Practice.
Doing math operations using int, double, float, and long
data types can be tricky.  You might find yourself rounding
up or down in order to achieve your desired output.  The
BigDecimalRunner class converts a number into a string object
and then converts it into a BigDecimal object in order to use
the math functions within that class.  Added a gitignore
file to play with it.

Managing character values as primitives.
CharArrayRunner practices creating objects from strings and
arrays.

StringPrinter
The string printer is a hackerrank problem for a programmer.
The code that is within the program here is functional,
however, on hackerrank it is not favored.  On Hackerrank, it
teaches the student that sometimes the line needs to be cleared
in order for a method like nextLine() can be used appropriately.

PangramRunner
A pangram is a string object that contains all letters of the
alphabet in any order and ignoring spaces and characters
outside of the alphabet.

Isogram Runner
An Isogram is a string object that has zero repeating
characters.  The program loops through a given string and
returns if the statement that was given by the user and
computes if the string is an isogram or not.

Adding JUnit
TDD or Test Driven Development is a form of coding that uses
test cases to run on a specific class in order too figure if
the code in the class being tested is working appropriately.
I am adding JUnit because the majority of employers use TDD
during their development phase.

Unique Characters
The Unique Characters program is a codewars challenge that
requests that a user give the program a given string.  For
all characters that are unique in the entire string, print
'(' to the console.  For all characters that occur more than
once in the string, print ')' to the console.
